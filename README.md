# simple WebApp

I created this project to get an idea of web development using go and react

## tech stack

+ Golang
    + gin
    + gin-oauth
+ React.js
    + react
    + jquery

## make it run

```
go run webapp.go
```
open Browser on

`http://localhost:8080`

## P.S.

for further monitoring you can install and run

`expvarmon -ports="1234"`

if https://github.com/divan/expvarmon/ is installed
